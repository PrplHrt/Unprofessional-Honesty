        "Today, while mindlessly looking at my Youtube home page, I stumbled upon a couple of videos by Grant Sanderson on his channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). Sanderson introduces the concept in a way that lets the viewer rediscover Hamming's methodology. I highly recommend watching the videos yourself to understand the contents of this post.\n",

        "After watching both videos, I felt inspired to try out the code that Sanderson displayed in the [second video](https://youtu.be/b3NxrZOu_CE). I created a simple Python code that first produces a random message comprised of 1s and 0s. The code then takes the generated message and changes the appropriate parity bits. The resulting message will then become a no-error version of the original. Below is the final, commented-version of the code:"
