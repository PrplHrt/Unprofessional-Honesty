[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).  

Inspired by fastai's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) and Rachel Thomas' [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), I hope to express myself and record my learning journey on this blog. 

As the title of the blog implies, I plan to be as frank as I can be. I don't have much of a track record with consistent effort, but I will be working on that with time. This blog will be one attempt to do so as I shout what I learn into the void.
