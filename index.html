My name is [Eyad Mohamed Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyad-abdelazim/). I'm a Computer Science undergrad who's also leading an [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/) group.

Inspired by fastai's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/) and Rachel Thomas' [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), I hope to express myself and record my learning journey on this blog. 

As the title of the blog implies, I plan to be as frank as I can be. I don't have much of a track record with consistent effort, but I will be working on that with time. This blog will be one attempt to do so as I shout what I learn into the void.

For those of you interested in doing the same, visit [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).
